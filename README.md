Kiwi(KIK) is a modern cryptocurrency built from scratch, designed to be efficient, decentralized, and secure. Here are some of the features and benefits:
* [Proof of space and time](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmRIb7lgi4QfKkNaxuKOBHRmwbVlGL4f7EsBDr_5xZE/edit) based consensus which allows anyone to farm with commodity hardware
* Very easy to use full node and farmer GUI and cli (thousands of nodes active on mainnet)
* Simplified UTXO based transaction model, with small on-chain state
* Lisp-style Turing-complete functional [programming language](https://chialisp.com/) for money related use cases
* BLS keys and aggregate signatures (only one signature per block)
* [Pooling protocol](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/Pooling-User-Guide) that allows farmers to have control of making blocks
* Support for light clients with fast, objective syncing
* A growing community of farmers and developers around the world
* Combining Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake Securely
